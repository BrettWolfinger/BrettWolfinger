## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Brett, a Gameplay Programmer working on personal projects
* Languages: C#, Verse, C++, Python

As a Ph.D. student, I co-founded the [Hopkins Game Dev Society](https://www.hopkinsgamedevsociety.com/), where we empower Johns Hopkins University students to create games by providing formal mentorship and hosting career-building events. Additionally, I am the Teaching Assitant for the university's only video game development class, 3D Computer Graphics and Game Programming, where we introduce students to Unity through a semester long team project.
